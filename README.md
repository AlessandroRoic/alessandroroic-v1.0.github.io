Personal website built with [Angular](https://angular.io/), designed and developed to showcase my skills and latest projects.
The initial purpose of this project was to make use of my current knowledge on Front End development with
2 years of experience on Angular, NgRx, RxJs and Bootstrap. Even though I think these frameworks and libraries are worth and
are very valuable for a big project (which is what I work in at my job) that was already made with it, they feel a bit overkill
for a personal website, and I wanted to make my portfolio as modular as possible. 

So from the next version I'm going to:
- Migrate from Angular to another framework that best suits this small project
- Cut down on unecessary libraries and plugins
- Build a modular and easly upgradable personal portfolio
